# Oracle PL/SQL
This is a copy of my design and scripts for the fantasy football game project that I worked on. The design is on the 3rd normal form, and consists of 14 tables. Before the data being inserted, all the sequences and tables scripts must be run. The scripts were originally written for Oracle, but can be easily modified and used for other databases.
